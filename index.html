<h2> From Day 0 onwards</h2>
<main>
<p>Starting from Day 0 and I only have the basics of
    HTML/HTML5 down, so I can't do much more than lists
    and barebones buttons and suchs but I'll be working on
    updating this with better visuals this week after I learn
    the basics of CSS
</p>
</main>
<p>For now though I'll do some basic shit and see eventually if
    I can make this interactive at all
</p>
