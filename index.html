<h2> From Day 0 onwards</h2>

<main>
<p>Starting from Day 0 and I only have the basics of
    HTML/HTML5 down, so I can't do much more than lists
    and barebones buttons and suchs but I'll be working on
    updating this with better visuals this week after I learn
    the basics of CSS
</p>
</main>
<p>For now though I'll do some basic shit and see eventually if
    I can make this interactive at all. Also <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/willypNYC">check out my twitter</a> and
    I may or may not be putting that in to test some hyperlink stuff I learned the other day
</p>
